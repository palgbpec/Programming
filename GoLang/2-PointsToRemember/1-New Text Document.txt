1. There should always be one main.go file

2. In this main.go file you need to declare package "main"  even though you don't have main folder

GoProject
		  src-->github.com-->basingh-->GolangTraining-->composition-->composition.go  
																					
																						 package composition1
																						 import "fmt"
																						 func SayHello() {
																						    fmt.Println("hello")
																						 }

		  src-->github.com-->basingh-->GolangTraining-->main-->main.go
																			package main
																			import (
																				"fmt"
																				"github.com/basingh/Golangtraining-repo1/composition"
																			)

																			func main() {
																				composition1.SayHello()
																			}
																			
3. if variable name and function starts with small letter then it can be accessed in another package.
Even variables declared inside structure has to start with capital letter in order to be access in another package
But the structure name can be small
Ex:
type employee struct {		//small letter work
	Empname string			//variable name has to be capital
	Empid   int				//capital
	Dept    *department    //capital
}

type department struct {   //small
	FK_empid int			//capital
	Vdept    string			//capital
}
