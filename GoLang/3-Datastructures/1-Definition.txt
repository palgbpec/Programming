1. Array
   a number sequence of elements fo a single type
   do not change in size
   
2. slice
   a list
   the value of an unitialized slice is nil
   change in size
   have a length and a capacity
 
3. map
   key/value
   map is unordered group of elements of one type, called the element type, indexed by a set of unique keys of another type, called the key type.
   The value of an uninitialized map is nil
   
4. struct
   a data structure
   a composite type
   allows us to collect properties together
   

Point To Remember : 
1. the value of uninitialized slice and map is nil
	
2. slice , map, channel are reference type , they are built on top of other datastructure
    or  they are referencing the underlying data structure
	Slice Has a header, length, capacity
	i.e holding the address of the underlying datastructure
