1. Removing extra characters
i) 
	grep -r $'\r' *
	Use -r for recursive search and $'' for c-style escape in Bash.

	More, if you are sure it's text file, then it should be safe to run

ii)
	tr -d $'\r' < filename
	to remove all \r in a file.

	If use GNU sed, -i can perform in-place edit, so you won't need to write back:

iii)  sed $'s/\r//' -i filename
