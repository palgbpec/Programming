------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hash Table - used for fast data lookup - symbol table for compilers, database indexing, caches,Unique data representation.

Trie - dictionary, such as one found on a mobile telephone for autocompletion and spell-checking.

Suffix tree - fast full text searches used in most word processors.

Stack - undo\redo operation in word processors, Expression evaluation and syntax parsing, many virtual machines like JVM are stack oriented.

Queues - Transport and operations research where various entities are stored and held to be processed later ie the queue performs the function of a buffer.

Priority queues - process scheduling in the kernel

Trees - Parsers, Filesystem

Radix tree - IP routing table

BSP tree - 3D computer graphics

Graphs - Connections/relations in social networking sites, Routing ,networks of communication, data organization etc.

Heap - Dynamic memory allocation in lisp
